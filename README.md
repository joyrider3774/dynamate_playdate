Dynamate is a puzzle game invented by Björn Kalzen and Jonas Norberg, a couple of years ago i contacted them to make a port for the gp2x handheld.
This version is port of my gp2x version made to work with the Playdate handheld.

## History
In 1995 Jonas Norberg and his friend Björn Kalzen developed the game initially for the Amiga.
Björn programmed and made levels, Jonas did the graphics, music and levels.
The game was released as licenceware by F1 in U.K. but only eleven persons discovered the game (according to F1). 
Since then Jonas has ported it to a few platforms himself and some other guys have ported it to other platforms including me for the gp2x and this Playdate version.

## Playdate Game Features:
- 30 default levels with increasing difficulty
- Adapted numbered pieces since playdate can't display colors to make it easier to recognize them.
- Level Editor to create your own levels to share with others
- Autosaves progress

## Playing the Game:
The aim of the game, in any level, is to clear the level of the numbered pieces. 
Pieces can be removed in a predefined way by moving another piece into them.
There are also pieces affecting the currently moving piece.

## Level Editor
The game includes a level editor, to create your own levels which you can share with other people.

### Basic usage
When you select the level editor menu, you can create a "new" level by choosing new or selecting an earlier created level by selecting "select level". 
Once inside level editing mode you can use the crank to cycle between level editor parts visible in the lower right part of the screen and place them inside the level by pressing the A button. The "empty" piece will erase blocks below the cursor.

Levels should follow these rules:
- Minimum of 2 numbered pieces
- Teleporters should have an even amount.

When you have finished creating your level you can press the (B) button to acces the menu again, choose save and choose a name for your level. Then you can exit out the leveleditor by choosing quit and in the main menu you can choose play and select user levels to select and play your levels.

### Sharing level packs
Levels are saved in the data folder of the game under the "levels" folder. You can copy your level(s)  and share with other people.
The other people will just need to extract your levels pack in the same folder on their own playdate and the levels will appear on their playdate as well. 
feel free to contact me if you created some good levels and want your level packs to be included in the download of the game
